[] Kubectl check command


# Vladimir commands

[ ] Use scientific language
    [x] Don't use K8S

[ ] Background should explain unikernel and k8s more
    [ ] Explain borg
    [ ] Alternatives are not real alternatives, they do different tasks. 

[] Improve 2.4 
    [ ] what do you want to bring with this section ?
    [ ] what do I want to tell the reader ?

[] Lit review -> Related Work
    [] move examples of unikernels to background
        [ ] Spend more time writing about them
    [] address "low resource devices dynamic management"
        [] Iot device management with k8s
            [] also for microcontrollers

[] Bigger Picture
    [] lower discussion to runC by OCI https://opensource.com/life/16/8/runc-little-container-engine-could

    [] Broaden solution 
        [] organize communication
        [] Sharing of sensor access between multiple unikernels
        [] EuroSys or Usenix ATC

[] Diagrams for:
    [] 4.2.3
    [] 4.2.4
    [] 4.3

[] Evaluation
    [] Where you performed the tests
    [] How many times
    [] Is figure average of results

[] Discussion about:
    [] Multiple sensors on same device, and data shared between them. 

[] Trying to make IoT more flexible => add it to kubernetes, allow sensor sharing.
[] Address this for single board and not for MCU.

[] Part of laptop seem detached, some form of pre evaluation. "I did this... it works in this scenario, but won't work for me"

[] Quality
    [x] Fig 4.1
    [x] Fig 5.1
    [] typos
    [] difference between edge and end
    [x] Fix figure 5.4.
