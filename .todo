# Vladimir commands

[ ] Use scientific language
    [x] Don't use K8S

[x] Background should explain unikernel and k8s more @high 
    [x] Explain borg
    [x] Alternatives are not real alternatives, they do different tasks. 

[x] Improve 2.4 
    [x] what do you want to bring with this section ?

[x] Lit review -> Related Work
    [x] move examples of unikernels to background
        [x] Spend more time writing about them
    [x] address "low resource devices dynamic management"
        [x] Iot device management with k8s
            [x] also for microcontrollers

[] Bigger Picture :
    [x] lower discussion to runC by OCI https://opensource.com/life/16/8/runc-little-container-engine-could @critical 

    [] Broaden solution
        [] organize communication
        [x] Sharing of sensor access between multiple unikernels
        [] EuroSys or Usenix ATC

[] Diagrams for:
    [x] 4.2.3
    [] 4.2.4 # parse xen output
    [] 4.3

[x] Evaluation
    [x] Where you performed the tests
    [x] How many times
    [x] Is figure average of results

[x] Discussion about:
    [x] Multiple sensors on same device, and data shared between them. 

[x] Trying to make IoT more flexible => add it to kubernetes, allow sensor sharing.
[x] Address this for single board and not for MCU. (Micro Controller Unit)

[x] Part of laptop seem detached, some form of pre evaluation. "I did this... it works in this scenario, but won't work for me"

[] Quality
    [x] Fig 4.1
    [x] Fig 5.1
    [] typos
    [] difference between edge and end
    [x] Fix figure 5.4.
