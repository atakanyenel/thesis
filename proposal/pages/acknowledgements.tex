%TODO: Acknowledgments
I would like to thank my advisor Vladimir Podolskiy for giving me the motivation to continue on the cloud computing path. He was a reliable mentor throughout my entire master's program.

Furthermore, I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Michael Gerndt for giving me the opportunity to work on on this topic.

Additionally, I would like to thank Leibniz-Rechenzentrum for providing me credits to conduct my experiments.

Finally, I thank my parents for always supporting me during my years of study. Teşekkürler.
