\section{Setting up the Kubernetes Cluster}
The cloud provider for this thesis is Leibniz-Rechenzentrum, LRZ. They are using the OpenStack \cite{openstack} interface to provide computing services to their customers. While developing on the cloud, microK8s was used for setting up local ,short-lived, single node clusters. The testing was done on a kubernetes cluster set up by following the official documentation on their website. In that case, there is a Kubernetes master running on VM with 20 GB Disk , 9 GB RAM, 2 VCPUs and running Ubuntu-18.04. The kubernetes version is v1.16.3, which is the latest release at the time of writing. A secondary node is used for scaling experiments with the configuration similar to the master but with 4.5 GB RAM. The master node has a public IP so that devices can connect to it without a VPN. The pod network add-on used by the cluster is Cilium \cite{cilium}, as it's also being used in MicroK8s.

Another approach was to use Google Kubernetes Engine for setting up managed clusters. While they are easier to set up , connecting to them through non-Google-controlled devices is much more harder. They either require a device that is authorised with the gcloud command line or they require a service account key file to be distributed alongside the kubeconfig file. While the first option was not a problem when registering the development PC as an additional node, it is not optimal to install and authorise gcloud on IoT devices. It is a big application with many additional dependencies like OpenSSL, thus unsuitable for the resource constraint requirement of edge devices. The second approach, is much more resource friendly, but just as similar to first approach, it is a security vulnerability waiting to be exploited as a misconfigured service accounts can ben used to run arbitrary commands on GCP using users' budget.

For local development, Minikube was also used on some parts of the project. Minikube only allows single node clusters unlike microK8s buy it was successful to register nodes through virtual kubelet to minikube.
